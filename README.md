# 🔥 Lag Switch for Roblox 🔥

**Undetectable by Byfron** (as of 8/16/2024)  

## 🚀 Features:
- **Undetectable**: Leaf Lag is undetectable by Byfron. Staff can still ban you though if they think you are suspicious.
- **Anti Timeout**: Leaf Lag has a built-in anti-time-out feature, ensuring that Roblox won’t disconnect you.
- **Stream Proof**: Leaf Lag is external, meaning you can safely screen share without the lagswitch overlay being displayed.

## 📖 How to Use:
1. **[Download the lag switch here.](https://github.com/SquareszLeaf/Leaf-LagSwitch/releases)**
2. Open the lagswitch with Roblox running.
3. Done! The lag switch should now be operational.

⚠️ **Warning**: Use with caution. Some games might auto-kick or close, potentially leading to a ban.
